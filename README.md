cowboy fileupload sample

Cowboy 0.9 release and master branch support different multipart request data processing APIs. Cowboy is a good erlang http library. But the author did not provide enough sample projects and user guides about http file upload processing.

This sample project provides a http file upload sample.

Reference to the user guide [cowboy multipart request manual](https://github.com/extend/cowboy/blob/master/guide/multipart_req.md) in cowboy master branch.
